# Running C# 13 Scripts With `dotnet run app.cs` (No Project Files Needed)

This repository (csharp13-scripting-examples) is available with Ziggy Rafiq's book **Running C# 13 Scripts With Dotnet Run App.cs.** available at **[C# Corner](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/members/ziggy-rafiq)**.

Using the latest .NET 9 SDK features such as top-level statements, global usage, and modern language enhancements, it provides practical examples, templates, and guidance for writing and executing C# 13 scripts without projects.
